# Fundamentals-of-Programming-in-Python

## Analysis and Reflection

  When I signed up for IT-75 I had no prior knowledge of coding in Python, or any computer language for that matter. If you told me that halfway through the semester, I'd be able to write a Password Locker program that allows users to store and encrypt their passwords, I would have laughed at the thought. The truth is though, by the end of day one I was already writing programs, albeit they were small and simple. With the Python language and the helpful instruction from Professor Amalong I have been able to learn and accomplish many things I never thought possible.
  Over the past two months we have been asked to create a variety of projects within Python
